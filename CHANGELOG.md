# Changelog

## v0.1.0 — 2026-06-10

### Infrastructure (Phase 0)
- **CI-ready fixture estate** (`tests/fixtures/`): 8 synthetic GPOs covering cpassword, MS16-072, version-skew, broken UNC, loopback, block-inheritance, enforced links, precedence conflicts, and blocked extensions. 25 fixture tests run without real `samples/`.

### Workstream A — AGPM-replacement story
- **`snapshot_changelog()` + `changelog` CLI**: Version-aware change log that pairs GPC/GPT version counter deltas with per-setting diffs. Distinguishes "metadata says N edits" from full setting detail.
- **`gpo-lens report` CLI**: Self-contained Markdown/HTML estate documentation export. Synthesizes estate summary, doctor findings by severity, topology overview, baseline compliance %, and change history. Print-to-PDF friendly.
- **`gpo-lens ingest --diff-latest`**: Auto-diff against the previous snapshot on ingest, appending to the changelog workflow.

### Workstream B — Security-analysis depth
- **`delegation` CLI + `delegation_deep_dive()`**: Privilege rollup (which trustees edit which GPOs), orphaned SID detection, and non-default-editor flagging.
- **`admx-gaps --admx-dir`**: Optional ADMX crosswalk integration — resolved registry paths are excluded from gap reports.
- **`loopback_awareness()` + `settings-at` banner**: Detects loopback mode (merge/replace) and prints a caveat banner when any GPO in scope configures loopback.

### Test coverage
- 280 tests (was 233), 237 non-samples tests (91.9% of total). `ruff` and `mypy --strict` clean.
