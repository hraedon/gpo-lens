"""Durable finding identity, lifecycle, and triage data model (Plan 024).

This module defines the typed protocol that every lifecycle-aware detector
emits, along with the persistence-model entities (evaluation run, occurrence,
observation, triage event). The deterministic core uses these types to track
findings across snapshots with provenance — *which* detector, rules,
catalogue, comparator, snapshot, and software version produced each claim.

Key distinctions (Plan 024 §2):

- **Finding definition:** the typed rule/check and its version.
- **Evaluation run:** one execution against a snapshot and optional comparator.
- **Finding fingerprint:** detector-specific canonical identity of the issue.
- **Occurrence:** one continuous interval from first observed until resolved.
- **Observation:** presence or absence in one evaluation run.
- **Triage event:** append-only local operator action about an occurrence.
- **Estate fact:** immutable snapshot input from which an evaluation was derived.

This module is a core module — no ``narration`` or ``web`` imports.
