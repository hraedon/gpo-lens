"""Finding evaluation, triage, and queries (Plan 024).

This module owns the Plan 024 finding surface: evaluation runs, the
occurrence/observation model, durable finding identity (fingerprints), the
append-only triage event log, and the core queries (``finding_inbox``,
``finding_history``, ``finding_delta``, ``accepted_risk_register``,
``evaluation_runs``). The legacy Plan 023 lifecycle writer (``finding_key``,
``update_finding_lifecycle``) moved to :mod:`gpo_lens._legacy_findings`.

Plan 024 features:

- **Evaluation provenance** — ``evaluation_run`` records track which detector,
  rules, catalogue, comparator, snapshot, and software version produced each
  claim.
- **Occurrence/observation separation** — an occurrence is one continuous
  interval; an observation is presence/absence in one run.
- **Enhanced triage** — risk acceptance with expiry/revocation, deterministic
  fold, append-only events.
- **Core queries** — ``finding_inbox``, ``finding_history``, ``finding_delta``,
  ``accepted_risk_register``, ``evaluation_runs``.

Stable finding key: ``(rule_id, subject_identity)`` where subject identity
reuses the normalized identities (GPO GUID, setting identity, trustee SID, …).
Keys are deterministic and stable across snapshot re-ingest of identical data.

**Single estate per store (WI-1.5).** The lifecycle engine assumes one estate
(one domain's snapshot series) per SQLite database. Finding fingerprints do not
include an estate/domain dimension, so pointing two different domains at the
same ``--db`` would fold their findings into one lifecycle series. Multi-estate
comparison (WI-059) is a separate, post-1.0 concern with its own model.

This module is a core module — no ``narration`` or ``web`` imports.

    converts each finding to a ``FindingCandidate`` with declared identity

    The adapter documents:

    - **Subject key:** GPO GUID for GPO-scoped findings; declared subject_key
      tuple for estate-level findings.
    - **Dimensions:** identity-bearing fields (side, ref_value, trustee SID)
      that distinguish multiple findings on the same subject.
    - **Rule versioning:** ``detector_version="1"`` for all intrinsic
      detectors. A future rule-semantics change bumps the version and must
      declare whether it continues the old lifecycle series or starts a new
      one.
    - **Evidence projection:** summary text truncated to 200 chars; no raw
      cpassword values, SDDL strings, or credentials stored.
    - **Coverage requirements:** absence is meaningful only when the subject
      GPO was actually re-collected (handled by ``run_evaluation``).
