"""Deterministic estate briefing (Plan 025 WI-2).

Answers one operator question — *do I need to care today?* — as typed facts plus
deterministic prose. This is **not** Tier 3 narration: no model is involved, the
sentences come from formatters over the facts, and the same inputs always
produce byte-identical output. That is what makes the briefing golden-testable.

Two deliberate design constraints:

**No detector re-runs.** Every number here comes from materialized lifecycle and
snapshot tables, not from re-evaluating the estate. The dashboard re-runs
``danger_findings`` and ``estate_doctor`` on each page view; the briefing must
not, because it is intended to become the landing page.

**No links in the core.** This module is a core module (no ``web`` imports), so
vitals carry a stable *key* rather than a URL and the template maps keys to
routes. Plan 025 WI-2 forbids an unlinked stat tile; keeping the key here and the
href there means the web layer cannot render a tile it has no destination for.

Honesty rules the plan calls out explicitly:

- With one snapshot there is no delta, so the briefing says so rather than
  implying a clean comparison against nothing.
- When the latest evaluation did not complete, the briefing reports the analysis
  as incomplete instead of presenting its partial counts as a clean delta.
- Coverage and provenance problems are ordered *before* favorable counts, so a
  reassuring "3 resolved" can never appear above the reason it is untrustworthy.
