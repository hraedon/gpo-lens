# Design — Per-user RSoP: principal-group effective policy (the honest middle tier)

**Status:** design draft  
**Author:** coding agent, from the "flag, don't simulate" RSoP boundary review  
**Scope:** deterministic core (`merge`, `topology`, `queries`, CLI/web presentation)  
**Related work items:** WI-028 (loopback mode parser), WI-051 (user+computer chain deduplication)  

## Strategic role

The project charter says *flag, don't simulate*: topology resolution is OU-level,
never object-level. Plan 019 extended that honesty to per-candidate gate
attribution. Plan 021 then built a real, bounded resultant for a principal from a
snapshot by evaluating **security filtering** from collected AD group membership.
That code is already shipping in `merge.principal_resultant`, but the *design*
has never been written down as a first-class boundary statement. This document
closes that gap. It formally defines the middle tier the project now occupies:
"principal-group effective policy" — more than "gates shown but not evaluated",
less than "true per-object RSoP". Naming the tier makes the tool's claims
auditable and its caveats legible to users.

## Ground truth at time of writing

The deterministic core already implements the building blocks:

- **`merge.build_token(estate, principal_sid)`** expands a principal's transitive
group membership (`estate.group_members`) into a `PrincipalToken`, adding
well-known SIDs and domain-relative groups (Domain Users / Domain Computers).
It records unresolved foreign SIDs as `token_caveats`.
- **`merge.principal_resultant(...)`** composes the full resultant: token
expansion, OU-chain resolution from a DN, security-filter gate evaluation against
the token, per-CSE merge-resolution, and explicit exclusion of WMI/ILT-gated
contributors. It returns `PrincipalResultant` with `settings`, `excluded`,
`excluded_settings`, `conditional_dangers`, `token_caveats`, and a
`caveat_summary`.
- **`topology.scope_caveats(estate, som_path)`** already emits the aggregated
caveats for security filtering, WMI, ILT, loopback, site links, and disabled sides.
- **`topology.effective_scope(...)`** gives a per-GPO scoping view including
explicit Apply trustees, WMI filters, loopback mode, and ILT presence.
- The collector already produces `principals.json` (SID → name/type) and
`group-members.json` (group SID → member SIDs), because Plan 020 collected
group membership for delegation resolution and dead-group detection.

What is **missing** is the design-level contract: *what exactly is simulated,
what is not, and why that is an honest middle tier rather than a charter
violation.* The code and the UI currently say "resultant given collected inputs";
this document says what that sentence means.

## Charter addendum (decisions this design records)

1. **Principal-group effective policy is in charter.** Evaluating security-filter
SIDs against collected AD group membership is *reading collected facts*, not
simulating Windows client behavior. Both sides of the intersection (token SIDs
and Apply-Group-Policy trustee SIDs) come from the static export. This is the
one gate that moves from "shown" to "evaluated."
2. **It is still not object-level RSoP.** We do not resolve per-machine WMI state,
per-user loopback replacements, per-item ILT conditions, primary-group nuances,
or deny-ACE interactions with the full token. Those remain caveats.
3. **Output stays labeled.** Result objects and UI never use the word "effective"
without the "given collected inputs" qualifier. The label is updated only after
lab calibration (see Plan 021 validation).
4. **Exclusion must never hide a danger.** GPOs or settings excluded because of
an unevaluated gate flow into `conditional_dangers` when they carry dangerous
configurations (Plan 018). A gated dangerous setting is still surfaced.
5. **User+computer pairs are first-class.** A user's full resultant requires the
computer token (post-MS16-072 Read behavior). The existing API already accepts an
optional `computer_sid` and `computer_dn`; this design endorses that shape.

## What IS simulated

These mechanisms produce deterministic output from the snapshot:

- **Security-filter SID resolution.** A principal's expanded token (SID + nested
and well-known group SIDs) is intersected with the GPO's Read+Apply/Apply Group
Policy trustees. If the token matches, the GPO enters the candidate set.
- **GPO apply/deny from security filtering.** GPOs whose Apply list does not
intersect the token are excluded from the deterministic resultant with a reason.
- **OU-chain precedence merge.** Applicable GPOs are merged according to the
DC-computed `gp-inheritance` order, with block-inheritance and enforced already
resolved by the collector.
- **Per-CSE merge semantics.** The merge-resolution model in `merge.py`
(LAST_WRITER_WINS, UNION, AUTHORITATIVE_REPLACE, ACCUMULATE for GPP actions,
SINGLE_WINNER, etc.) determines surviving values.
- **Disabled-side exclusion.** Settings from a disabled Computer/User side are
not merged (they are surfaced separately as disabled-but-populated findings).

## What is NOT simulated (the caveat banner)

These are surfaced explicitly in every result, never silently assumed:

- **Loopback processing.** The merge/replace mode may change which user-side
settings apply on affected computers. `loopback_awareness` reports the mode, but
the user-side resultant is not rewritten by loopback until WI-028 validates the
mode parser and the design elects to apply it.
- **WMI filter evaluation.** A WMI filter name and query are collected and
attached, but the query is not evaluated against any actual machine state. A
WMI-filtered GPO is excluded and listed as conditional.
- **Item-level targeting (ILT).** GPP per-item conditions (group, OS, OU,
registry/file/RAM/IP/time) are not evaluated. ILT-gated GPP items are excluded
and listed as `excluded_settings`.
- **AD-site membership.** Site SOMs exist as a parallel scoping axis, but the
per-machine AD site is not resolved. Site-linked GPOs are flagged, not folded
into the deterministic chain.
- **Deny-ACE interaction with the full token.** Deny ACEs within a GPO's own
security descriptor are honored for that GPO's Apply set (the existing
security-gate already does this). Broader deny ACE interactions across the token
cannot be fully evaluated against partial collection.
- **Primary-group and foreign-security-principal edge cases.** Token expansion
uses collected membership; any unresolvable SIDs are recorded as caveats.

## Data flow

```text
principal SID
   ↓
build_token(estate, principal_sid) → PrincipalToken
   ↓
for each GPO in the principal's OU-chain precedence:
   ├─ evaluate_security_gate(GPO, token_sids) → applies / excluded + reason
   ├─ if computer_sid given: include computer token in gate evaluation
   └─ if WMI/ILT gated: exclude and record as conditional
   ↓
applicable GPOs → merge_settings_with_exclusions(chain_entries)
   ↓
PrincipalResultant {
   settings, excluded, excluded_settings,
   conditional_dangers, token_caveats, caveat_summary
}
```

The flow reuses existing functions: `build_token`, `_evaluate_security_gate`,
`som_effective_gpos` (chain resolution), `merge_settings_with_exclusions`, and
`scope_caveats` for presentation. New work is largely documentation, tests, and
thin presentation glue.

## What already exists vs. what is new

Already exists:

- Token construction and transitive group expansion (`merge.build_token`).
- Security-filter evaluation (`merge._evaluate_security_gate`).
- Per-CSE merge-resolution (`merge.cse_merge_mode`, `merge.merge_settings_with_exclusions`).
- Conditional-danger surfacing (`merge._build_conditional_dangers`).
- OU-chain resolution (`topology.som_effective_gpos`).
- Scoping caveats (`topology.scope_caveats`, `topology.effective_scope`).

What this design adds:

- A formal contract document that names the middle tier.
- Acceptance criteria that lock the boundary:
  simulated mechanisms + non-simulated mechanisms + caveat coverage.
- UI/CLI affordance: a persistent caveat banner on every principal resultant
  view listing the non-simulated mechanisms.
- Test fixtures and calibration cases that prove the simulated part matches
  `gpresult` on simple cases and that every divergence is a listed caveat.

## Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1** A test fixture with a user in a group that is security-filtered on a
GPO produces that GPO's settings in the principal's `PrincipalResultant.settings`.
- **AC-2** A test fixture with a user whose token does **not** intersect a GPO's
Apply trustees excludes that GPO with reason `"security filter: token does not
intersect Apply trustees"`.
- **AC-3** A GPO with an attached but unevaluated WMI filter is excluded from the
deterministic `settings` list and appears in `excluded` with kind `wmi_filter`.
- **AC-4** An ILT-gated GPP item is excluded from `settings` and appears in
`excluded_settings` with kind `ilt`.
- **AC-5** Every `PrincipalResultant` carries a non-empty `caveat_summary`
containing the "given collected inputs" qualifier and counts of excluded /
conditional / approximate items.
- **AC-6** When a computer SID is supplied for a user principal, the computer
side of the computer's OU chain is merged and loopback state is surfaced in the
caveat summary (not silently applied).
- **AC-7** A dangerous configuration inside a gated (WMI/ILT/security-filter)
GPO appears in `conditional_dangers`, never in `settings`.
- **AC-8** The UI and CLI never render the word "effective" without the adjacent
"given collected inputs" label.
- **AC-9** A principal whose token cannot be fully expanded (foreign / unresolved
SIDs) carries those unresolved SIDs in `token_caveats`.
- **AC-10** Lab calibration: for at least two known (user, computer) pairs in
LABDOMAIN, the snapshot resultant matches `gpresult /h` on all deterministic
settings, and every divergence is exactly one of the listed non-simulated
caveats.

## Tests & validation

- Unit tests in `tests/test_merge.py` for token/gate/merge behavior using
synthetic fixtures (no real domain identifiers).
- A new `tests/test_principal_resultant_boundary.py` that asserts each AC above,
especially the caveat banner contents.
- Calibration additions in `test_calibration.py` against LABDOMAIN `gpresult`
exports, following the WI-029 cross-check discipline (external oracle, never the
tool's own output).

## Non-goals

- True object-level RSoP (per-user security/WMI/loopback simulation). The
charter still forbids that. This design stops at principal-group effective
policy.
- Live AD bind or continuous monitoring. Inputs remain static export files.
- Partial WMI/ILT evaluation. Blanket exclusion keeps the result conservative.
- Modeling deny-ACE interactions across the entire token. Only per-GPO
Apply-trustee deny precedence is evaluated.
- Changing the output label to unqualified "effective" before lab calibration.

## Sequencing & risk

- **Effort:** small. Principal work is documentation, tests, and presentation;
the core computation already exists in `merge.py`.
- **Risk:** low. No new AD bind, no import-boundary crossing, no data-model
changes. The main risk is over-claim in documentation or UI; AC-8 and the
caveat banner mitigate it.
- **Suggested sequencing:** ship this document alongside a test + UI caveat pass,
not as a code refactor. It can land in any v1.x release once the tests are
passing.
- **Dependencies before trusting the user+computer path:** WI-028 (loopback mode
parser) and confirmation that the WI-051 deduplication logic handles double-chain
collection correctly.
